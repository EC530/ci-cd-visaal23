# Matrix Multiplication with Time Measurement

This assignment provides a Python implementation of a matrix multiplication function that not only computes the product of two matrices but also measures the computation time taken for the operation.

## Features

- Matrix multiplication of two matrices provided as lists of lists.
- Computation time measurement of the multiplication operation.
- Validation of matrix dimensions before multiplication.
- Error handling for incompatible matrices.
