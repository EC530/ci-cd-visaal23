# Matrix Multiplication Package

This Python package provides a simple implementation of matrix multiplication. It includes robust error handling, logging, and a comprehensive testing suite built with Pytest.

## Features

- **Matrix Multiplication**: Multiply two matrices provided they have compatible dimensions.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles errors related to incompatible matrix dimensions.
- **Logging**: Logs the process of matrix multiplication, including successful operations and errors.
- **Testing**: A suite of tests using Pytest to ensure the correctness of the multiplication operation.
